        <p>The Everglades are essential for fish and wildlife, but the system also provides enormous benefits to people,
            as it:
        <ul>
            <li>Provides drinking water for more than 8 million Floridians</li>
            <li>Protects communities from hurricanes and floods</li>
            <li>Supports Floridaâ€™s $1.2 billion fishing industry</li>
            <li>Generates $150 million of direct spending annually just in Everglades National Park</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        Regrettably, human actions have altered the natural flow of water throughout the Everglades. The result is an
        ecosystem in collapse. Since the 1800s, water diversions and flood-control projects have severed the flow of
        water between different parts of the Everglades, while large areas of its lands were converted to agricultural
        or residential areas.

    <div class="block right">Support the creation of a reservoir in the Everglades Agricultural Area</div>

    <p>
        A critical piece of restoring the Everglades is to construct a reservoir south of Lake Okeechobee. The
        Everglades Agricultural Area reservoir is a part of CERP that is designed to relieve the pressure on the
        St.Lucie and Caloosahatchee estuaries by taking up water from Lake Okeechobee that is currently damaging the
        east and west coasts. The reservoir will store and treat water before sending it south to the Everglades
        National Park and Florida Bay, where it is needed most. In 2017, the Florida Legislature passed a bill to
        accelerate planning and provide half the funding for the construction of a reservoir in the Everglades
        Agricultural Area.
        This proposed reservoir has slightly less capacity than the one called for in CERP, but it is an excellent first
        step on a long-overdue effort to send water south. There is still a long road to the construction of the
        reservoir and since the cost of CERP projects are split between the state and the federal government, funds
        still need to be approved and matched by Congress.
